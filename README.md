•objective was to develop an advanced predictive model to
accurately assess the credit risk of loan applicants, using
historical loan application and repayment data.
• Random Forest works well as compare to Naive Bayse with
86% accuracy score.
•By using Logistic Regression with PCA and
regularization,Random Forest,XGBoost,SVM and sequential
model on anonymous dataset we achieved 99% accuracy
with XGBoost .
